## External recommended information sources

1. [MIT brief but well-written review on joint distributions](https://math.mit.edu/~dav/05.dir/class7-prep-a.pdf)
2. [Nice introductory coverage of confidence intervals](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/pglasserman/B6014/ConfidenceIntervals.pdf)

    Note that in the subtopic "Comparing Two Means" there is given the most complicated case, when we do not know variances $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ of two populations, moreover they may not be equal to each other. We didn't cover this case, and it's better here to follow our materials.
